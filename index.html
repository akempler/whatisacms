				<h1>What is a CMS?</h1>
				<aside class="notes">
					This came up as a question, and I'm glad it did.
					Because the concept is a pain point that comes up when we don't do our job of explaining the
					concept properly. The benefits, and while I don't like to label them as negatives,
					they are area that require embracing a different mindset when it comes to content creation.
				</aside>

				<section>
					<h1>Content</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>We'll start with a comparison of content in a static system like Dreamweaver vs a cms like Drupal.</p>
						<p>Why? Because wrapping your mind around how content is created and handled in Drupal requires understanding how it differs from something like Dreamweaver.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>File-based Content</h3>
					<h4>(Non-CMS solution)</h4>
					<ul class="fragment fade-up">
						<li>html files in folders
							<ul>
								<li>No reuse</li>
								<li>Limited search and filtering</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Static content is essentially just a big page of html.</p>
						<p>A little secret, even in a cms like Drupal we can have static content, but we try to avoid it.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Database Driven Content</h3>
					<p>Drupal CMS solution</p>
					<ul class="fragment fade-up">
						<li>Like a spreadsheet
							<ul>
								<li>Columns and Rows</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Part of this initiative is to define how best to break down your content into columns.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>[spreadsheet example]</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Advantages</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Reusability</li>
						<li>Fine level of control</li>
						<li>Structured</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						BUT you do sacrifice some flexibility in page design.
						You can't just do anything you want.
						Structured is an advantage because it provides consistency.
						However, again, it does mean some loss of control/flexibililty that can take some getting used to.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Management</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Empowered Content Creators</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is at the heart of why to choose a cms.
						No need to wait for a developer to add a piece of content or update the home page.
						But there is a balance. And that is part of this discovery as well.
						Finding the things that you will need to change - "manage" and building them in a way
						that lets your users have that level of control.
						And leaving things that are unlikely to change often as hard-coded.
						A necessity of time, budget and complexity.
						With a static system, the technology gets in the way of productivity.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Workflow & Moderation</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						A properly set up cms is a dynamic system.
						Content flows in from a myriad of sources and is likewise distributed and
						access by multiple sources -
						different groups and types of users,
						different distribution/consumption points (desktop, mobile, social).
						With that constant flow of content, a cms provides mechanisms for
						quickly understanding all of the content in the system,
						who created it, where it is assigned, what state it's in,
						and even things like when it was last updated or viewed.
						As well as fined grained permissions for creation, editing and access.
						TIE THIS back to "system" or move it there?
					</aside>
				</section>

			<section>
				<section>
					<h1>System</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						A collection of elements or components that are organized for a common purpose.
						Can also mean, I have my "system" of doing things.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Components Aligned for a Common Goal</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Enabling you to communicate quickly & efficiently with a minimum of effort.
						</li>
					</ul>
